The :any:`Relative Free Energies with the OpenFE CLI <rbfe_cli_tutorial>`
tutorial walks users through how to use the OpenFE command line to calculate

Associated with it is also a :any:`notebook <rbfe_python_tutorial>`
for how to achieve the same outcomes using the Python API.

Python API Showcase
-------------------

Our :any:`showcase notebook <showcase_notebook>`
walks users through how to use the main components of OpenFE to create a
